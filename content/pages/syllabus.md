Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Overview
--------

We live in an increasingly virtual world. We interact over email and IM; we meet new people and keep up with friends via their online profiles. We are continuously building a vast record of our various transactions, a personal portrait in clicks, words and video. And our communications are becoming integrated into the walls of our homes and offices, a ubiquitous blanket of connectivity.

This virtual world is wholly synthetic: the design of the underlying system shapes how you appear, what you can see and hear, and who has access to what. As designers, we are responsible for thinking about the impact of our creations: we can envision a future in which technology expands our sociability, making an extraordinarily creative, communicative and cooperative world, but we can also envision a dystopic future where friendship has become a conduit for marketing and awareness of universal surveillance choreographs our every move.

Requirements
------------

Requirements include weekly readings followed by short writing assignments, three design projects, active class participation and a final project.

### Design review: interaction space; depicting conversation

Maps of conversations can show many things: who participated? What was their role? How did the topic evolve? And these maps can themselves be landscapes, the context for future discussions
